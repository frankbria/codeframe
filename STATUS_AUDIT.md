# CodeFRAME Status Audit (2025-10-17)

## Issue: Documentation Discrepancy

AGILE_SPRINTS.md uses task IDs (cf-16, cf-17, cf-18, cf-19, cf-20) that conflict with beads tracker assignments.

## WHAT IS NOT DONE

### ❌ Sprint 3: Autonomous Agent Execution (0% Complete)

**AGILE_SPRINTS.md labels these as cf-16 through cf-20, but these IDs are already used in beads for Sprint 2 tasks!**

The actual Sprint 3 tasks that need to be done:

1. **Backend Worker Agent** (no beads issue yet)
   - NOT cf-16 (that's PRD Generation - already done)
   - Needs NEW beads issue
   - Status: NOT STARTED
   - Estimated: 8-10 hours

2. **Test Runner** (no beads issue yet)
   - NOT cf-17 (that's Discovery State Management - already done)
   - Needs NEW beads issue
   - Status: NOT STARTED
   - Estimated: 4-6 hours

3. **Self-Correction Loop** (no beads issue yet)
   - NOT cf-18 (that might exist but for something else)
   - Needs NEW beads issue
   - Status: NOT STARTED
   - Estimated: 6-8 hours

4. **Git Auto-Commit** (cf-19 in AGILE_SPRINTS.md, but cf-19 in beads is Discovery!)
   - Status: NOT STARTED
   - Priority: P1 (not blocker)
   - Estimated: 2-3 hours

5. **Real-time Dashboard Updates** (cf-20 in AGILE_SPRINTS.md, but cf-20 in beads is Discovery Questions!)
   - Status: NOT STARTED
   - Priority: P1
   - Estimated: 4-6 hours

---

## ROOT CAUSE

AGILE_SPRINTS.md was written with placeholder task IDs (cf-16, cf-17, etc.) but when actual implementation happened:
- Sprint 2 tasks got assigned cf-15 through cf-29
- Sprint 3 foundation got cf-32, cf-33
- **Sprint 3 execution tasks were never created in beads**

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### 1. Create Beads Issues for Sprint 3 Execution
```bash
bd create --title "Backend Worker Agent - Task execution with LLM" --type feature --priority P0
bd create --title "Test Runner - Pytest integration" --type feature --priority P0
bd create --title "Self-Correction Loop - Auto-fix test failures" --type feature --priority P0
```

### 2. Update AGILE_SPRINTS.md
Replace placeholder IDs (cf-16, cf-17, cf-18) with actual beads issue numbers

### 3. Cross-Reference Table
Create mapping between AGILE_SPRINTS.md labels and actual beads IDs

---

## CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

**Completed Sprints**: 0, 1, 2 ✅
**Sprint 3 Foundation**: ✅ COMPLETE (cf-32 indexing, cf-33 git workflow)
**Sprint 3 Execution**: ❌ NOT STARTED (no beads issues exist)

**Next Step**: Create beads issues for Sprint 3 execution tasks, then implement Backend Worker Agent.
