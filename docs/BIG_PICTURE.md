# CodeFRAME: The Big Picture

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-17
**Current State**: Sprint 3 Foundation Complete, Starting Autonomous Execution

---

## What CodeFRAME Is

CodeFRAME is an **autonomous AI development team** that turns your project ideas into working software through conversation. You describe what you want, and AI agents write the actual code, run tests, fix bugs, and deploy—all while you watch through a live dashboard.

Think of it as **hiring a team of AI developers** who never sleep, never forget context, and get smarter over time.

## How It Works: The Journey

### **Stage 1: Discovery** ✅ COMPLETE (Sprint 2)

**You**: "I want to build a SaaS for project management"

**Lead Agent**:
- Asks 5 intelligent questions (Socratic discovery)
- Captures your answers with structured metadata
- Learns about your users, features, constraints, tech stack

**Output**:
- Structured discovery data
- Clear understanding of requirements

---

### **Stage 2: Planning** ✅ COMPLETE (Sprint 2)

**Lead Agent**:
- Generates comprehensive PRD from discovery
- Breaks PRD into hierarchical issues (1.0, 1.1, 1.2...)
- Decomposes issues into granular tasks (1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3...)

**Example**:
```
Issue 1.5: User Authentication
  └─ Task 1.5.1: Create User model
  └─ Task 1.5.2: Implement password hashing
  └─ Task 1.5.3: Add login endpoint
  └─ Task 1.5.4: Write authentication tests
```

**Output**:
- PRD document
- 40+ executable tasks with dependencies
- Priority and workflow ordering

---

### **Stage 3: Execution** 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 3)

**This is where the magic happens.**

#### **3.1 Task Assignment**

**Lead Agent**:
- Picks highest priority task: "1.5.1: Create User model"
- Checks dependencies (are previous tasks done?)
- Assigns to Backend Worker Agent

#### **3.2 Autonomous Coding** ⬅ CF-41 (You Are Here)

**Backend Worker Agent**:
1. **Reads task** from database
2. **Queries codebase index** (cf-32): "What files/classes exist related to User?"
3. **Builds context**: Related files, symbols, dependencies
4. **Calls Claude API**: "Write the User model for this task"
5. **Receives code**: Complete Python file with tests
6. **Writes file**: `codeframe/models/user.py`
7. **Updates status**: Task → "in_progress" → "completed"

#### **3.3 Testing & Self-Correction** 🔜 CF-42, CF-43

**Test Runner** (cf-42):
- Runs `pytest tests/test_user.py`
- Parses results: 4/5 tests passing, 1 failure

**Self-Correction Loop** (cf-43):
- Backend Agent reads failure
- Analyzes error: "AssertionError: password not hashed"
- Regenerates fix
- Reruns tests
- Repeats up to 3 attempts
- ✅ All tests passing!

#### **3.4 Git Workflow** ✅ CF-33 COMPLETE

**Git Branching**:
- Task 1.5 starts → Creates `issue-1.5-user-authentication` branch
- Agents commit to this branch
- All tasks for 1.5 complete → Auto-merge to `main`
- Triggers deployment to staging

#### **3.5 Real-Time Updates** 🔜 CF-45

**Dashboard Shows**:
```
Backend Agent: Working on Task 1.5.2 ⚙️
├─ Created user.py
├─ Running tests... 3/5 passing
└─ Fixing test failure (attempt 1/3)

Frontend Agent: Idle (waiting on Task 1.7)
Test Agent: Completed Task 1.4 ✅
```

## The Database Schema (Simplified)

```sql
projects
  ├─ id, name, status, phase, created_at
  └─ Tracks project lifecycle

issues (e.g., "1.5: User Authentication")
  ├─ id, project_id, issue_number, title, description
  ├─ status, priority, workflow_step
  └─ Hierarchical grouping of tasks

tasks (e.g., "1.5.2: Implement password hashing")
  ├─ id, project_id, issue_id, task_number
  ├─ title, description, status, priority
  ├─ assigned_to, depends_on, can_parallelize
  └─ Granular executable units

agents
  ├─ id, type (lead, backend, frontend, test)
  ├─ provider (claude), maturity_level (D1-D4)
  ├─ status (idle, working, blocked)
  └─ current_task_id, metrics

git_branches (cf-33)
  ├─ id, issue_id, branch_name
  ├─ created_at, merged_at, merge_commit
  └─ Tracks feature branches

memory
  ├─ id, project_id, category, key, value
  └─ Stores discovery data, PRD, conversation history
```

## Key Design Decisions

### **Why SQLite?**
- Simple, embedded (no separate server)
- Perfect for MVP and local dev
- Can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed

### **Why Tree-sitter?**
- Fast, incremental parsing
- Multi-language support (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust...)
- Industry standard (used by GitHub, Neovim, etc.)

### **Why Claude (Anthropic)?**
- 200K context window (huge!)
- Strong at code generation
- Tool use capabilities
- Strict TDD methodology

### **Why Git Branching?**
- Safe isolation (feature branches)
- Easy rollback if agents break things
- Standard development workflow
- Enables code review (future)

### **Why Hierarchical Issues/Tasks?**
- Mirrors real development (epics → stories → tasks)
- Clear dependency management
- Progress tracking at multiple levels
- Enables parallel execution

---

## The Development Philosophy

### **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
Every feature follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR:
1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **GREEN**: Make test pass (minimal code)
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality

**Why?**
- Ensures tests actually verify behavior
- Prevents regressions
- Documents expected behavior
- High confidence in changes

### **Strict Documentation**
Every major feature has:
- Design specification (before coding)
- Implementation details (during coding)
- Test coverage report (after coding)
- AGILE_SPRINTS.md updates (on completion)

**Why?**
- Clear requirements prevent scope creep
- Future developers understand decisions
- Easy onboarding
- Institutional knowledge preserved

### **Agent-First Thinking**
Ask: "Could an agent do this autonomously?"
- If yes → Design for agent execution
- If no → Maybe needs human-in-the-loop

**Why?**
- Forces clarity in requirements
- Reduces manual work
- Scales infinitely
- Enables 24/7 development
