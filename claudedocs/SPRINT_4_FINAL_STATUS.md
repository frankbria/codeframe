## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### 3 Failing Integration Tests (Edge Cases)
1. **Retry Logic Edge Case** (2 tests)
   - Impact: Low - basic retry works, complex retry scenarios fail
   - Root Cause: State machine exits early when task transitions to 'failed'
   - Recommendation: Refine in Sprint 5

2. **Circular Dependency Detection Edge Case** (1 test)
   - Impact: Low - basic cycle detection works (unit tests prove it)
   - Root Cause: Specific dependency graph pattern not covered
   - Recommendation: Add more test patterns in Sprint 5

### 1 Module Below Coverage Target
- **agent_pool_manager.py**: 76.72% (target: 85%)
- Impact: Low - core functionality well-tested
- Missing: Agent retirement, status reporting, cleanup methods
- Recommendation: Add 8-10 tests in Sprint 5

### 2 Environment-Related Test Failures
- **test_worker_agent.py**: 2 subprocess tests fail
- Impact: Low - functionality verified in integration tests
- Root Cause: pytest not in subprocess PATH
- Recommendation: Fix environment setup
