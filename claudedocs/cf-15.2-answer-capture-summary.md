# cf-15.2: Answer Capture & Structuring - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented answer capture and structuring system for CodeFRAME's Socratic discovery using strict TDD approach.

## Deliverables

### 1. Test Suite (`tests/test_discovery_answers.py`)
- **25 comprehensive tests** organized into 5 test classes
- **100% pass rate** achieved
- **98.47% code coverage** (exceeds 85% requirement)

Test Categories:
- `TestAnswerCaptureBasics` (4 tests): Core capture functionality
- `TestFeatureExtraction` (4 tests): Natural language feature parsing
- `TestUserExtraction` (4 tests): User/persona identification
- `TestConstraintExtraction` (4 tests): Technical constraint extraction
- `TestStructuredDataGeneration` (5 tests): PRD-ready data generation
- `TestEdgeCases` (4 tests): Edge case handling (unicode, special chars, etc.)

### 2. Implementation (`codeframe/discovery/answers.py`)
- **AnswerCapture** class with full functionality
- **Methods implemented**:
  - `capture_answer(question_id, answer_text)`: Stores user responses
  - `extract_features(answers)`: Parses features from natural language
  - `extract_users(answers)`: Identifies user types and personas
  - `extract_constraints(answers)`: Extracts technical/business constraints
  - `get_structured_data()`: Generates PRD-ready structured output

### 3. Module Structure
```
codeframe/discovery/
├── __init__.py           # Module exports
└── answers.py            # AnswerCapture implementation
```

## Key Features

### Natural Language Processing
- **Comma-separated lists**: "login, signup, password reset"
- **Conjunctions**: "authentication and authorization"
- **Action verbs**: "can login", "needs authentication"
- **Technical terms**: Automatic detection of common patterns
- **Case-insensitive**: Normalizes all extractions

### User Extraction
- Direct role mentions: "developers", "administrators"
- Compound roles: "software engineers", "project managers"
- Context-aware parsing: Distinguishes users from features

### Constraint Extraction
Categorizes constraints into:
- `database`: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite
- `frontend`: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- `backend`: Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go
- `cloud`: AWS, Azure, GCP
- `performance`: Response time requirements
- `security`: GDPR, HIPAA, encryption requirements

### Structured Output Format
```python
{
    "features": [...],          # Extracted feature list
    "users": [...],             # User types/personas
    "constraints": {...},       # Categorized constraints
    "confidence": {...},        # Confidence scores per category
    "raw_answers": {...}        # Original question→answer mapping
}
```

## TDD Process Followed

### RED Phase
- Wrote 25 failing tests first
- Verified import errors and missing implementation
- Established clear test requirements

### GREEN Phase
- Implemented AnswerCapture class
- Created extraction methods
- Achieved passing tests (23/25 initial)

### REFACTOR Phase
- Improved regex patterns for better feature extraction
- Enhanced handling of "X, Y, and Z" patterns
- Added support for multi-word features
- Fixed edge cases (unicode, special characters)
- **Result**: 25/25 tests passing

## Example Usage

```python
from codeframe.discovery.answers import AnswerCapture

# Capture answers
capture = AnswerCapture()
capture.capture_answer("q1", "Authentication for a SaaS app. Users are developers.")

# Extract structured data
data = capture.get_structured_data()

# Output:
# {
#     "features": ["Authentication", "SaaS", "app"],
#     "users": ["developers"],
#     "constraints": {},
#     "confidence": {"features": 0.8, "users": 0.8, "constraints": 0.0},
#     "raw_answers": {"q1": "Authentication for a SaaS app. Users are developers."}
# }
```

## Integration Notes
- **No database dependency** in this subtask (as specified)
- **Simple text parsing** without ML/NLP (as specified)
- **Ready for cf-15.3** database integration
- **Module design** allows easy extension for advanced NLP later

## Coverage Details
- Only 2 lines not covered (both in complex regex branches)
- All public methods: 100% coverage
- All test scenarios: 100% pass rate
- Edge cases: unicode, special chars, long text - all handled

## Quality Metrics
✅ 25/25 tests passing (100%)
✅ 98.47% code coverage (target: 85%)
✅ Type hints on all methods
✅ Comprehensive docstrings
✅ PEP 8 compliant
✅ No linting errors
✅ Professional code organization

## Next Steps (cf-15.3)
Integration with database for persistent storage of:
- Captured answers
- Extracted entities
- Session management
- PRD generation pipeline
