Accept `phase` prop\n2. Accept phase-specific data prop (e.g., `issuesData`)\n3. Select appropriate data source based on phase\n4. Handle phase transitions gracefully\n\n## Testing Strategy\nEach component should have 'late-joining user' E2E tests that verify:\n- Correct display during each phase\n- Smooth data source switching during phase transitions\n- Graceful degradation when data is loading\n\n## Related Work\n- TaskStats fix: this branch\n- Late-joining user E2E tests: commits cb408ed, e1539b8\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T23:05:26.460792556-07:00","updated_at":"2026-01-16T13:34:29.99484581-07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T13:34:29.99484581-07:00","close_reason":"Superseded by v2 Feature Roadmap","labels":["frontend","tech-debt"]}
