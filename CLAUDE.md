# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new, empty project directory. No codebase has been initialized yet.

## Getting Started

When initializing this project, update this file with:

1. **Build and Development Commands**: How to build, run, test, and lint the project
2. **Architecture Overview**: High-level structure and key architectural decisions
3. **Project-Specific Conventions**: Naming patterns, directory organization, and coding standards specific to this codebase

## Next Steps

Once the project is initialized with a tech stack and initial code, re-run `/init` to generate comprehensive guidance based on the actual codebase structure.
